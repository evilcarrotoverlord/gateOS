gateOS
has all one would ever want from a cc:tweaked based dialing computer for Just stargate (i hope)
- fully touch compatible for monitor only usage (5wide,3high)
- address book
  - automated address lenght calculation based on entered parameters
  - import/export of addresses to a floppy
  - per address idc settings
  - option to select a address to dial via redstone signal
  - cached energy requirements to see if the gate can dial it before you dial the actual address
- address input via onscreen keyboard, real keyboard, dhd(for the current gatetype)
- custom color settings for the ui
- iris controlls
  - always open/close
  - close on incomming wormhole
  - idc settings to open it
- fancy animations like:
  - diffrent gate frames/chevrons based on connected gate
  - chevrons light up based on those that are on on the gate
  - iris/wormhole animation
  - while dialing it shows the currently dialed glyph (as best as i could replicate it in the limitations of a 9x9 grid)
- a system logger accessed by pressing the text in the bottom right corner
- newly added update feature which should pull all versions here on github
